For the second individual project, you will analyse in details a remote website by observing its responses over the Internet. Your objective is to write a short (4 pages) report that describes in details the key technical elements that you have found while interacting with this server.

Connect to your web server by using a browser with developper extensions to be able to analyse in details the HTTP requests that are sent and the headers that are received. Try to identify the following information :


   * list all the domain names that are accessed when retrieving a page from this web server. Store these names in a CSV file for next week.
   * list all the different types of ressources (html, css, javascript, flash, …) that are retrieved. For each ressource, collect the size, type and server from which they are downloaded
   * list the TCP port numbers that are used to contact the server (80, 443 for https, and other port numbers)
   * For each HTTP request that you send, collect :
   *
      * the header lines that your browser sends (you should try with different browsers to see how the server reacts to different clients)
      * the cookies that are used (do not only use your default browser because it could send cookies that you have accumulated while browsing other websites)
      * Are there header lines that are non-standard ? If so, try to document their usage
   * For each HTTP response that you receive, collect :
   *
      * the version of HTTP used by the server (1.0, 1.1,
      * the header lines that are returned by the server and analyse them to see whether you find something strange in these replies
   * Whenever possible, try to do some scenarios on the website that could lead to different behaviours, e.g. do a search in the website’s search box, try to register as an identified user, try to upload or download specific information from the website, ...

During you analysis, try to detect anything which is unexpected and try to explain this strange behaviour. Your objective is to provide technical details about the precise operation of this particular website.

We'll send you one email per week to inform you about the different points that you should address in your analysis.

If you have questions, please post them on icampus

Hello,

Please find below some suggestions for information that you might want to study concerning the DNS of the website that you analyse.


The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a key role in the operation of Internet servers such as the web servers that you analyse for this project. For each important domain name that is used by servers that you analyse (not only the main web server, but also the other servers that could host some specific resources or advertisements, …) try to find the following :

- What are the Name Servers (NS DNS record) that support this domain. Are they accessible over IPv6 and IPv4 or only one protocol ?
- Do the domain names that you contact have only A records (IPv4) or both A and AAAA (records) ?
- Do they use CNAMEs ?
- What is the TTL of the DNS responses ?
- Does the DNS resolver that you contact always return the same A/AAAA records or is there some form of load balancing in the DNS ?
- Do all DNS resolvers provide the same answer to your request ? (If your web server is supported by a CDN, the DNS resolvers will probably reply with the address of a close CDN server)

In cooperation with the RIPE Atlas measurement platform (http://atlas.ripe.net), we can help you to answer the last question by running DNS queries from measurement nodes outside Belgium. Atlas provides an API that enables us to perform measurements from any RIPE Atlas node. This measurement will give you more information about the access to the website that you analyse from other countries. We will run the measurement script on Monday Nov 24th. You can request measurements from RIPE Atlas nodes by adding the DNS names for which you need information on the course wiki. The measurement results will be available in JSON format from the RIPE Atlas website.
